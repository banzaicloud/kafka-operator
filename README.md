# Kafka-Operator

The Banzai Cloud Kafka operator is a Kubernetes operator to automate provisioning, management, autoscaling and operations of [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) clusters deployed to K8s.

## Overview

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed streaming platform. Some of the main features of the **Kafka-operator** are:

- Provision secure and production ready Kafka clusters
- Fine grained broker configuration support
- Advanced and highly configurable External Access via LoadBalancers using Envoy
- Graceful Kafka cluster scaling (up and down) and rebalancing
- Monitoring via Prometheus
- Encrypted communication using SSL
- Automatic reaction and self healing based on alerts (plugin system, with meaningful default alert plugins)

>We took a different approach to what's out there - we believe for a good reason - please read on to understand more about our [design motivations(docs/features.md) and some of the [scenarios](docs/scenarios.md) which were driving us to create the Banzai Cloud Kafka operator.


### Motivation

At [Banzai Cloud](https://banzaicloud.com) we are building a Kubernetes distribution, [PKE](https://github.com/banzaicloud/pke) and a hybrid-cloud container management platform, [Pipeline](https://github.com/banzaicloud/pipeline) and operate managed Kafka clusters for our customers. Apache Kafka predates Kubernetes and it has been designed mostly for `static` on-premise environments. State management, node identity, failover, etc is all part and internal to Kafka, thus making it properly work on Kubernetes and an underlying dynamic environment could be a challenge. 

There are already several approaches to operate Kafka on Kubernetes - however we did not find any of them appropriate for a highly dynamic environment, nor satisfying our customer needs. Also there is a huge interest in the Kafka community for a solution which enables Kafka on Kubernetes, both in the open source and closed source space. 

- [Helm chart](https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-helm-charts/tree/master/charts/cp-kafka)
- [Yaml files](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka)
- [Strimzi Kafka Operator](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator)

To deep dive into some of the details of the most popular existing solutions and our approach please check this table:

|               | Banzai Cloud | Krallistic | Strimzi | Confluent|

| Fine grained broker volume support  | Yes (learn more) | Limited via StatefulSet|Limited via StatefulSet|Limited via StatefulSet|

Finally, our motivation is to build an open source solution and a community which drives the innovation and features of this operator. We are long term contributors and active community members of both Apache Kafka and Kubernetes, and we hope to recreate a similar community around this operator.

## Installation

The operator installs the 2.1.0 version of Apache Kafka, and can run on Minikube v0.33.1+ and Kubernetes 1.12.0+.

As a pre-requisite it needs a Kubernetes cluster (you can create one using [Pipeline](https://github.com/banzaicloud/pipeline)). Also, Kafka requires Zookeeper so you need to first have a Zookeeper cluster if you don't already have one.

> We believe in the `separation of concerns` principle, thus the Kafka operator does not install nor manage Zookeeper. If you would like to have a fully automated and managed experience of Apache Kafka on Kubernetes please try it with [Pipeline](https://github.com/banzaicloud/pipeline).

##### Install Zookeeper

To install Zookeeper we recommend using the [Pravega's Zookeeper Operator](https://github.com/pravega/zookeeper-operator).
You can deploy Zookeeper by using the Helm chart.

```bash
helm repo add banzaicloud-stable https://kubernetes-charts.banzaicloud.com/
helm install --name zookeeper-operator --namespace=zookeeper banzaicloud-stable/zookeeper-operator
kubectl create --namespace zookeeper -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: zookeeper.pravega.io/v1beta1
kind: ZookeeperCluster
metadata:
  name: example-zookeepercluster
  namespace: zookeeper
spec:
  replicas: 3
EOF

```

### Installation

We recommend to use a **custom StorageClass** to leverage the volume binding mode `WaitForFirstConsumer`

```bash
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
  name: exampleStorageclass
parameters:
  type: pd-standard
provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```
> Remember to set your Kafka CR properly to use the newly created StorageClass.

1. Set `KUBECONFIG` pointing towards your cluster 
2. Run `make deploy` (deploys the operator in the `kafka` namespace into the cluster)
3. Set your Kafka configurations in a Kubernetes custom resource (sample: `config/samples/banzaicloud_v1alpha1_kafkacluster.yaml`) and run this command to deploy the Kafka components:

```bash
# Add your zookeeper svc name to the configuration
kubectl create -n kafka -f config/samples/example-secret.yaml
kubectl create -n kafka -f config/samples/banzaicloud_v1alpha1_kafkacluster.yaml
```

> In this case you have to install Prometheus with proper configuration if you want the Kafka-Operator to react to alerts. Again, if you need Prometheus and would like to have a fully automated and managed experience of Apache Kafka on Kubernetes please try it with [Pipeline](https://github.com/banzaicloud/pipeline).


### Easy way: installing with Helm

Alternatively, if you are using Helm, you can deploy the operator using a Helm chart [Helm chart](https://github.com/banzaicloud/kafka-operator/tree/master/charts):

```bash
helm repo add banzaicloud-stable https://kubernetes-charts.banzaicloud.com/
helm install --name=kafka-operator --namespace=kafka banzaicloud-stable/kafka-operator -f config/samples/example-prometheus-alerts.yaml
# Add your zookeeper svc name to the configuration
kubectl create -n kafka -f config/samples/example-secret.yaml
kubectl create -n kafka -f config/samples/banzaicloud_v1alpha1_kafkacluster.yaml
```

> In this case Prometheus will be installed and configured properly for the Kafka-Operator.
